I grew up playing the games of Matthew Smith and went into software engineering in no small part due to the amount of fun that games like Manic Miner and Jet Set Willy added to the home micros of the early 1980s. Reading magazines like Your Spectrum and learning of pseudo-witchcraft POKE commands that could modify these games just fanned the small flames of interest in programming. I'd go on to enjoy Infocom's interactive fiction, learn about parsers, and specialize in compilers.

But Manic Miner still holds a special place in my heart. And for that reason it is that, finding myself with a little time on my hands and the desire to do something pretty different to my day job and life offline, I decided to see if I finally had the skills to create Manic Miner myself.

The aim - and I'm by no means the first to do this in Python with Pygame - is to recreate the original as faithfully as possible. Movement, graphics, sound, behaviors, and - most of all - feel. None of the original code has been reused nor replicated. This is my own code, written from scratch.

I was fortunate in my adulthood to meet Matthew Smith and even have my original Spectrum signed by him (thank you for that Matthew - you'll be pleased to hear it wasn't sold on ebay but instead has pride of place in my office).

I understand Mr. Smith has previously stated he's ok with others playing with his brainchild so long as it's not for profit:
